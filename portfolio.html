                        <p> My name is Sasha Henry and I am
                            18 years old. I graduated from Porter Ridge High School in June of 2018. I
                            can be a little quiet at times, but I'm very friendly and when I'm comfortable I can
                            actually be very
                            outgoing.
                            Anime and video games has always been my thing since I was little, and some actually call me
                            a bit of a
                            nerd
                            which
                            is a title I'll accept. I'm into different types of music, but more often than not you'll
                            catch me
                            listening to
                            BTS which is my favorite k-pop group. In my spare time I like to cook, crotchet, and
                            occasionally practice
                            playing my guitar.
                        </p>

                        <p> Originally, I wanted to join the military (Navy), but I gained cold feet and decided as an
                            alternative that
                            web development would be the best course of action. Reason being is because the world is
                            constanty
                            revovling
                            around technology and I wanted a stable career with a steady income. I didn't want to go to
                            college because
                            I
                            constantly hear the same story of people having a degree that I'll never use. I hate having
                            my time and
                            money
                            wasted. I like to be productive and effiecient with everything that i do.
